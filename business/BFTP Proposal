Executive Summary: Mimir Labs LLC
The Opportunity: Eliminating the "Customization Tax" in PA Manufacturing
Pennsylvania’s 14,000+ manufacturers are currently hitting a "complexity ceiling." To scale, they must choose between "Excel Hell" or legacy ERP systems (NetSuite, Sage) that require $50k–$150k in custom subsidies just to fit their business process. This "Technical Debt" is a multi-billion dollar drain on the Commonwealth’s industrial base.
The Innovation: Yggdrasil & The Deterministic Core
Mimir Labs has developed Yggdrasil, a deterministic operations engine. Unlike legacy systems that require custom code to function, Yggdrasil uses a modular, articulated framework. Business logic flows through a stable engine rather than being forced into a rigid box. This ensures "Clean ERP" migrations that are audit-ready (SOC 2/CGMP) and implementation-lean, reducing time-to-value by 75%.
Market Traction: The 2026 Validation Cohort
Based in Harrisburg and partnered with Harrisburg LaunchBox, Mimir Labs is currently scaling an active Validation Cohort of mid-market industrial partners. We are engaging regional Industrial Resource Centers to prove that a "Zero-Customization" model can stabilize supply chains and provide Universal Business Intelligence without the annual maintenance hikes of legacy incumbents.
The Ask & Impact
Mimir Labs is seeking a BFTP venture investment to finalize industry-specific hardening of the deterministic core and onboard specialized systems engineering talent. This investment will anchor high-wage tech jobs in South Central PA and provide local manufacturers with a globally competitive, domestic software alternative.

1. Product & Technology
Differentiator: Our proprietary Deterministic Core architecture. We don't sell "flexibility" (which leads to broken code); we sell "structural integrity."
B2B Connectivity: Yggdrasil is built for the Agentic AI era, where deterministic data reliability is a prerequisite for autonomous supply chain orchestration.
2. Management Team
The Lead: Christopher "Doc" Gaither, CEO/COO. A domain expert in enterprise operations and systems architecture.
Strategic Advantage: Our "solo-plus-advisor" model allows for high agility, supported by technical consultants from the Harrisburg University ecosystem.
3. Sales & Marketing
Distribution Strategy: Partnering with specialized ERP distributors (VARs) who are frustrated by the low margins of legacy "bastardization" projects.
Direct Outreach: High-precision targeting of firms outgrowing "Starter Tech" (Zoho, Jobber, Excel) through our "De-Exceling" thought leadership.
4. Financials & Use of Funds
Direct R&D: Hardening the logic flows against real-world manufacturing data.
Compliance: Achieving SOC 2 Type II audit-readiness to serve highly regulated industries.
Sales Engineering: Supporting our first 5 "Launch Team" implementations.

Mimir Labs: 3-Year Financial Growth Model (Simplified)
Year 1: Validation & Hardening (Focus: The First 5)
Target: 5 "Founding Partner" implementations (The Validation Cohort).
Revenue Model: $4,800/mo subscription + $15,000 one-time "Clean Migration" fee.
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): ~$288,000.
One-Time Services Revenue: $75,000.
Total Year 1 Revenue: $363,000.
Primary Expense: R&D for the Deterministic Core and SOC 2/CGMP hardening.
Goal: Prove "Zero-Bastardization" architecture works across 3 different manufacturing sub-verticals.
Year 2: Scaled Distribution (Focus: The Launch Team)
Target: 25 Active Clients (Acquired via MANTEC and ERP Distributors).
Revenue Model: $4,800/mo average contract value (ACV).
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $1.44M.
Margin Strategy: Shift implementation to Certified Partners. Mimir Labs keeps 100% of the SaaS fee; partners keep 100% of the migration fee.
Primary Expense: Customer Success and Systems Engineering hires in the Harrisburg tech corridor.
Goal: Establish Yggdrasil as the "Regional Standard" for PA mid-market manufacturing.
Year 3: Global B2B Orchestration (Focus: The Growth Team)
Target: 100 Active Clients (Expanding beyond PA to the Mid-Atlantic).
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $5.76M.
Revenue Diversification: Introduce "B2B Connected" transaction fees for supply chain orchestration between Yggdrasil nodes.
Gross Margin: Target 85%+ (Typical for high-efficiency SaaS with deterministic logic).
Goal: Achieve Venture-Scale metrics for a Series A exit or significant BFTP follow-on investment.

Capital Efficiency:
Unlike legacy ERPs that require a 1:5 ratio of "Software to Services" (for every $1 of software, the client spends $5 on custom code), Mimir Labs aims for a 1:0.25 ratio. By eliminating the "Customization Tax," we can capture higher software margins while our partners focus on high-value strategic consulting rather than debugging "bastardized" code.
The "Locked-In" Advantage:
By offering Founder Rates to the initial cohort, we secure high retention (LTV) and create a "Moat" against legacy incumbents who typically raise prices 15-20% annually. Our growth is driven by the structural integrity of the Deterministic Core, not aggressive sales overhead.

Mimir Labs: Use of Funds Strategy
1. Technical R&D & Core Hardening (50% - $100,000)
The Action: Hiring a Senior Systems Architect or Lead Developer based in the Harrisburg tech corridor.
The Goal: Finalizing the Deterministic Core logic to handle high-variance manufacturing edge cases. This moves the product from "Beta/Validation" to "Market-Ready" for the MANTEC cohort.
BFTP Impact: High-wage technical job creation in South Central PA.
2. Compliance & Industrial Hardening (25% - $50,000)
The Action: Engaging specialized auditors and security consultants to finalize SOC 2 Type II and CGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) protocols.
The Goal: Making Yggdrasil "Audit-Ready" for highly regulated B2B sectors (Medical Devices, Aerospace, Food/Bev).
BFTP Impact: De-risking the platform for enterprise-level adoption.
3. Sales Engineering & Launch Support (15% - $30,000)
The Action: Funding the "Implementation Credits" for the first 5 Validation Cohort partners.
The Goal: Ensuring the first 5 migrations are 100% successful with "White Glove" service, creating the case studies needed for Year 2 scaling.
BFTP Impact: Direct economic support for PA-based small-to-mid-sized manufacturers.
4. Operational Overhead & Marketing (10% - $20,000)
The Action: "De-Exceling" thought leadership campaigns and trade show presence at regional events like Manufacturing Matters.
The Goal: Building the inbound lead engine for the "Growth Team" tier of distributors.
BFTP Impact: Establishing Mimir Labs as a regional brand authority.
