Grant Proposal Summary: Deterministic ERP Hardening for PA Manufacturing
Project Title:
Eliminating "Customization Debt" in PA Manufacturing: Validation and Hardening of a Deterministic ERP Core.
Principal Investigator (Faculty Partner): [To Be Named - Target: Data Science or Systems Engineering Dept.]
Industrial Partner: Mimir Labs LLC (Harrisburg, PA)
Project Overview:
Pennsylvania’s 14,000+ manufacturers are currently trapped in the "ERP Implementation Paradox." To adopt modern software, firms are forced to "bastardize" their unique, successful processes to fit rigid legacy boxes, or pay for expensive, fragile custom code. This project seeks to validate Yggdrasil, a deterministic ERP engine developed by Mimir Labs, which allows business logic to flow through the system rather than being forced into it.
Research Objectives:
Process Mapping & Flow Validation: Partner with 2-3 local PA manufacturers to map complex "last-mile" workflows (e.g., specialized inventory, multi-stage assembly) against Yggdrasil’s deterministic core.
Compliance Hardening: Develop and verify automated documentation protocols within the Yggdrasil framework to meet SOC 2 Type II and CGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practice) standards.
Universal BI Integration: Analyze the impact of "Built-in vs. Bolted-on" business intelligence on real-time decision-making speed for floor managers.
Expected Economic Impact for Pennsylvania:
Cost Reduction: Eliminating the "$50k-$150k Customization Tax" typically required for mid-market ERP deployments.
Speed to Value: Reducing ERP implementation timelines from 12+ months to under 90 days.
Workforce Development: Training [University Name] students in next-generation Agentic ERP architectures, creating a talent pipeline for the Harrisburg tech corridor.

Subject: Research Partnership Opportunity: Manufacturing PA Innovation Grant
Dear Professor [Name],
I’m Christopher "Doc" Gaither, CEO/COO of Mimir Labs. We are a Harrisburg-based firm developing Yggdrasil, a deterministic ERP core designed to eliminate technical debt for mid-sized manufacturers.
I’m looking for a faculty partner to co-submit a Manufacturing PA Innovation Grant for the 2026 cycle. We want to fund a student-led research project to "harden" our deterministic flows against real-world manufacturing data.
This project offers your students hands-on experience with B2B-connected architectures and Universal BI, while providing the university with a direct link to the PA Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED).
Are you open to a 15-minute meeting to discuss how we can leverage this grant to support your department's research and our local manufacturing base?
Best regards,
Christopher "Doc" Gaither
CEO/COO, Mimir Labs
