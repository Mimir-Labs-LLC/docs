# Mimir Labs — 5-Year Financial Projections

*Yggdrasil ERP | B2B SaaS for Mid-Market Manufacturing*

---

## Market Positioning

Yggdrasil targets a gap in the manufacturing ERP market: companies too large for horizontal tools (Odoo, Zoho) but priced out of or underserved by legacy incumbents (Epicor, Infor, Syspro). Our modular architecture lets customers start with 3 modules and expand as they grow, while our modern tech stack (C++/Qt desktop, Next.js web, PostgreSQL) delivers a faster, more intuitive experience than aging on-premise solutions.

## Pricing

Revenue is split across two streams: one-time implementation fees paid at onboarding and recurring monthly subscriptions.

| Tier | Recurring | Impl Fee | First-Year Total | Includes |
|------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **Starter** (3 modules) | $9,600/yr | $6,000 | $15,600 | 5 seats, standard support |
| **Professional** (6 modules) | $22,800/yr | $14,000 | $36,800 | 15 seats, priority support |
| **Enterprise** (all 10 modules) | $57,600/yr | $25,000 | $82,600 | Unlimited seats, dedicated CSM |

Implementation fees cover discovery, data migration, integration setup, user training, and 30 days of go-live support. Recurring pricing is positioned at 10–40% of incumbent TCO, with renewals becoming increasingly compelling as the implementation investment is amortized.

## Key Assumptions

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sales cycle | 60–120 days (mid-market B2B) |
| Monthly churn | 2.0% Year 1 improving to 0.8% Year 5 |
| Tenant mix (Year 1 to 5) | Starter-heavy early, shifting to Professional/Enterprise |
| Team model | Lean engineering-first org leveraging AI-assisted development and ops |
| Funding model | Bootstrapped to profitability; optional growth capital in Year 3+ |

## Revenue

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| New tenants added | 15 | 40 | 80 | 140 | 200 |
| Churned tenants | 2 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 22 |
| **Active tenants (EOY)** | **13** | **47** | **115** | **237** | **415** |
| Tier mix (S / P / E) | 40/40/20 | 35/42/23 | 25/45/30 | 18/45/37 | 15/45/40 |
| | | | | | |
| *Recurring revenue* | | | | | |
| Blended ARPT (monthly) | $1,600 | $1,800 | $2,150 | $2,450 | $2,600 |
| **Recurring ARR** | **$250K** | **$1.02M** | **$2.97M** | **$6.97M** | **$12.9M** |
| | | | | | |
| *Implementation revenue* | | | | | |
| Blended impl fee / tenant | $13,000 | $13,700 | $15,300 | $16,600 | $17,200 |
| **Impl revenue** | **$195K** | **$549K** | **$1.22M** | **$2.33M** | **$3.44M** |
| | | | | | |
| **Total revenue** | **$445K** | **$1.57M** | **$4.19M** | **$9.30M** | **$16.3M** |

Revenue is driven by three compounding effects: net new tenant acquisition, natural mix shift toward higher-value tiers as customers expand module adoption, and front-loaded implementation fees that accelerate early cash flow.

## Expenses

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Team size (FTE) | 2 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 |
| Payroll + benefits | $140K | $360K | $850K | $1.55M | $2.5M |
| Infrastructure | $20K | $60K | $180K | $400K | $700K |
| Sales & marketing | $40K | $150K | $350K | $600K | $900K |
| AI tooling | $3.4K | $3.4K | $3.4K | $3.4K | $3.4K |
| G&A | $20K | $50K | $90K | $140K | $200K |
| **Total expenses** | **$223K** | **$623K** | **$1.47M** | **$2.69M** | **$4.30M** |

Our operating model is intentionally lean. A small, senior team augmented by AI-assisted development and operations consistently delivers output comparable to organizations 2–3x our headcount. We hire for leverage, not coverage.

## Profitability

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Total revenue** | $445K | $1.57M | $4.19M | $9.30M | $16.3M |
| **Total expenses** | $223K | $623K | $1.47M | $2.69M | $4.30M |
| **Net income** | $222K | $947K | $2.72M | $6.61M | $12.0M |
| **Cumulative net** | $222K | $1.17M | $3.89M | $10.5M | $22.5M |
| **Net margin** | 50% | 60% | 65% | 71% | 74% |

## Revenue Mix

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|---|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Recurring % | 56% | 65% | 71% | 75% | 79% |
| Implementation % | 44% | 35% | 29% | 25% | 21% |

The revenue mix naturally shifts toward recurring over time as the installed base grows. By Year 5, implementation fees represent only 21% of total revenue — demonstrating a healthy, predictable subscription foundation with implementation as incremental upside on new sales.

## Unit Economics

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| ACV (recurring, blended) | $19,200 | $31,200 |
| First-year value (recurring + impl) | $32,200 | $48,400 |
| CAC | $4,000 | $6,500 |
| LTV (recurring only, at avg churn) | $80,000 | $260,000 |
| LTV:CAC | 20x | 40x |
| Payback period | ~2 months | ~2 months |
| Revenue per employee | $223K | $652K |

## Growth Trajectory

- **Year 1:** Product-market fit validation with 13 anchor tenants. Profitable from month one with $222K net income, driven by front-loaded implementation revenue.
- **Year 2:** $1.6M total revenue. Repeatable sales motion established. Team scales from 2 to 4. Implementation fees fund growth without external capital.
- **Year 3:** $4.2M total revenue. Expansion revenue begins compounding as Starter tenants upgrade. Recurring base crosses $3M ARR. Optional inflection point for growth capital.
- **Year 4:** $9.3M total revenue. Enterprise tier becomes dominant growth driver. 71% net margins fund continued organic expansion.
- **Year 5:** $16.3M total revenue ($12.9M recurring ARR) across 415 tenants with 74% net margins and $22.5M cumulative earnings. At 5–8x recurring ARR, implied valuation of **$65–103M**.

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Long mid-market sales cycles | Starter tier ($15.6K first year) lowers entry barrier; land-and-expand into Professional/Enterprise |
| Incumbent competition (Epicor, Infor) | Modern UX, 10–50% of incumbent TCO, faster implementation timeline |
| Implementation delivery at scale | Standardized onboarding playbooks; template-driven data migration reduces per-tenant effort as volume grows |
| Team capacity at scale | AI-augmented operations; hire ahead of support demand in Years 3–4 |
| Customer concentration (early) | Diversify across manufacturing verticals; no single tenant >15% of ARR |
| Churn at premium pricing | ERP is inherently sticky; deep workflow integration raises switching costs; implementation investment increases retention |
