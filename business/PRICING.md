## Implementation Fees — What's Included

One-time per module, paid at onboarding:

- **Discovery & configuration** — Workflow mapping, field customization, business rule setup
- **Data migration** — Import from existing systems (CSV, legacy ERP export, spreadsheets)
- **Integration setup** — API connections to existing tools (accounting, shipping, etc.)
- **User training** — Role-based training sessions for end users and administrators
- **Go-live support** — 30 days of dedicated support during production rollout

Bundle implementation fees include a discount over à la carte module fees and cover cross-module integration testing.

## Per-Seat Add-Ons

Additional seats beyond tier allocation: **$10/user/mo**

## Pricing Rationale

- **Implementation fees** align incentives: customers get hands-on onboarding that ensures adoption, while Mimir Labs captures value from the highest-effort phase of the relationship. First-year economics are front-loaded, reducing time to payback on customer acquisition costs.
- **Lower recurring pricing** (vs. pure-subscription models) reduces sticker shock on annual contracts and makes renewals frictionless — the implementation fee is already sunk, and the ongoing cost is demonstrably affordable.
- **Manufacturing & Finance** command the highest prices at both layers — deepest schema complexity (BOMs, GL double-entry, OEE), heaviest query load, and greatest compliance/audit burden.
- **Warehouse/Logistics & Sales** are priced next — high-transaction-volume modules with real-time components (route planning, WebSocket events, picking workflows).
- **CRM, PLM, Purchasing, Quality, Service** occupy the mid-tier — essential but more bounded in scope.
- **Projects** is the lightest — fewer tables, simpler workflows, typically supplementary to other modules.
- **Enterprise first-year at ~$83K** is still 10–50% of incumbent TCO (Epicor, Infor, Syspro), with renewals at $57.6K/yr — positioning Yggdrasil as an increasingly compelling value over time.
