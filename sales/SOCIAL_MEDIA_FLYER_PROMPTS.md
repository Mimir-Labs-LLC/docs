## Flyer 1: "The Software Tax" (Problem Awareness)

### Gamma Prompt

```
Create a bold, modern social media flyer (1080x1080) for a B2B SaaS company called Mimir Labs.

HEADLINE (large, top):
"Your ERP Charges You Per Head. We Don't."

SUBHEADLINE (smaller, below):
"Mid-market manufacturers pay $50-$200 per user per month for legacy ERP. That's up to $100K/year just in seat licenses."

BODY (center section, use a simple comparison):

Left column — "Legacy ERP"
• $150K+ implementation
• 12-24 month go-live
• $50-200/user/month
• 15-20% annual maintenance hikes
• Separate PLM software required

Right column — "Yggdrasil ERP"
• $15K-$83K first year (all-in)
• 90-day go-live
• Flat-rate pricing, no per-user fees
• Price-locked founder rates
• PLM built in natively

BOTTOM (call to action):
"Stop paying the Software Tax."
mimirlabs.io

LOGO: "MIMIR LABS" in clean sans-serif at bottom corner.

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Dark background (#0F172A or near-black navy)
- Accent color: electric teal (#06B6D4) for highlights and the Yggdrasil column
- Legacy column in muted red/gray to signal "bad"
- Yggdrasil column in teal/green to signal "good"
- Clean, modern tech aesthetic — no stock photos
- Typography: bold sans-serif (Inter, Geist, or similar)
- Subtle grid or circuit-board pattern in background
- Professional B2B tone, not consumer/playful
```

## Flyer 2: "What's Inside" (Product Feature Showcase)

### Gamma Prompt

```

HEADLINE (top, bold):
"14 Modules. One Platform. Zero Duct Tape."

SUBHEADLINE:
"Everything a manufacturer needs — from quote to cash, shop floor to shipping dock."

Row 1: CRM | Sales | Purchasing
Row 2: Manufacturing | Warehouse | Logistics
Row 3: Finance | HR | Projects
Row 4: PLM | Quality | Service
Row 5 (spanning): Workflows | Admin

FEATURE CALLOUTS (below the grid, 3 highlighted stats):

"150+ API Endpoints" | "126 Database Tables" | "6 End-to-End Business Processes"

BOTTOM SECTION — Three key differentiators as short pills/badges:
• "Native PLM — No Third-Party Add-Ons"
• "Live UPS/FedEx/USPS Rate Shopping"
• "Real-Time B2B Supply Chain Mesh"

FOOTER:

- Module badges in teal (#06B6D4) with white text
- Feature callout numbers in large, bold teal
- Differentiator pills in subtle dark cards with teal borders

## Flyer 3: "Founding 5" (Validation Cohort CTA)

### Gamma Prompt

```
Create an exclusive, high-impact social media flyer (1080x1080) for a limited partnership offer from Mimir Labs.

HEADLINE (top, large and bold):
"We're Selecting 5 Founding Partners."

SUBHEADLINE:
"The 2026 Yggdrasil Validation Cohort — for manufacturers ready to lead, not follow."

SECTION 1 — "What You Get" (left-aligned list with checkmarks or teal bullets):
✓ Lifetime founder rate: $4,800/mo (Enterprise tier, locked)
✓ Direct access to our engineering team
✓ Priority roadmap influence
✓ 100% of deposits credited toward migration
✓ Early SOC 2 Type II compliance hardening
✓ White-Glove implementation included

SECTION 2 — "What We Ask" (smaller, right-aligned or below):
• Anonymized operational data for platform testing
• Bi-weekly 30-min validation sessions
• Case study rights (anonymized)

SECTION 3 — urgency strip across bottom third:
"5 spots. That's it. First cohort shapes the product."

FOOTER:
"Apply at mimirlabs.io"
MIMIR LABS | Harrisburg, PA

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- Premium feel — dark background with subtle gold or amber accent (#F59E0B) alongside teal
- "5" should appear as a large, semi-transparent watermark number in the background
- The word "Founding" should feel exclusive — think private club invitation
- Clean sans-serif typography, high contrast
- No stock photos — purely typographic and geometric
- Slight texture or noise overlay on background for depth
- Professional and exclusive, not salesy or desperate
- Think: "You were selected" not "Please buy"
```
