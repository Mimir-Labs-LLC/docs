# SOP: STRATEGIC PROSPECTING & B2B OUTREACH (YGGDRASIL ERP)

### 1. RECONNAISSANCE: FINDING "TECH DEBT" SIGNALS
We use **Bloomberry.com** to identify companies whose current technology is a "growth blocker".
*   **The Search:** Use the Technographics filter for **Legacy ERPs** (e.g., NetSuite, Sage 100/300, Microsoft Dynamics GP, or older SAP versions).
*   **The Signal:** Look for companies in **Manufacturing or Distribution** whose web presence hasn't updated in 3+ years. This indicates high "Technical Debt"—systems that are too fragile or expensive to change.

### 2. THE TARGET PROFILE (THE "WHO")
*   **Ideal Firm:** Mid-market B2B companies (50–250 employees) that need to launch a modern **B2B Marketplace** but are "locked-in" to an old system.
*   **Personas:** 
    *   **The COO:** Worried about operational bottlenecks and "chaos" during upgrades.
    *   **The CFO:** Tired of 15–20% annual maintenance fee hikes for outdated software.

### 3. THE VALUE PROP: RESOLVING TECH DEBT
We aren't just selling software; we are selling a **2026 Roadmap** that includes:
*   **Marketplace Readiness:** Native support for B2B vendor portals and agentic commerce.
*   **Audit-Ready Infrastructure:** SOC 2 / CGMP hardening included, not an "add-on".
*   **Fixed-Rate Security:** A locked-in $4,800/mo "Founder Rate" to kill the "Software Tax" (maintenance hikes).

### 4. REFINED OUTREACH TEMPLATE (NO SCRAPER MENTION)
**Subject:** [Company Name] // 2026 Infrastructure & Tech Debt

"Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out because [Company Name] fits the profile of the scaling B2B firms we’re partnering with for our **2026 Yggdrasil ERP Cohort**.

Many organizations in [Industry] are currently hitting a ceiling due to the **technical debt** and 'closed-box' limitations of legacy ERP systems. These outdated platforms often make it impossible to launch a modern **B2B Marketplace** without massive custom coding costs.

We are selecting five Charter Members for a **Strategic Reserve**—securing an audit-ready, SOC 2-compliant engine at a locked-in rate of $4,800/mo. This ensures a no-chaos transition for teams planning their 2026 infrastructure now.

Are you the right person to discuss your 2026 roadmap with, or should I connect with someone else on the operations team?

Best,
[His Name]
Mimir Labs"

### 5. TRACKING & "PATTERN RECOGNITION"
*   **Personalization:** If you find a recent press release or job post about "hiring for [Legacy ERP] Admin," mention that their team's efficiency is a priority.
*   **Follow-up:** If no response, send a 2nd touch in 5 days focusing on **"The CFO’s Case"** (ROI and cost-certainty).

# FOLLOW-UP: THE FINANCIAL CASE (YGGDRASIL ERP)

**Timing:** Send 4-5 business days after the initial outreach.

**Subject:** Re: [Company Name] // 2026 Infrastructure & Tech Debt

"Hi [Name],

I’m following up on my previous note regarding the **2026 Yggdrasil ERP Cohort**.

Beyond the technical debt, many CFOs in [Industry] are currently projecting **15–20% annual maintenance hikes** from their legacy ERP providers. These 'Software Taxes' often outpace the actual utility of the platform.

For our five Charter Members, we’re locking in a **$4,800/mo 'Founder Rate'** for 24 months. This provides:
1. **Cost Certainty:** No surprise hikes while you scale.
2. **Audit Readiness:** 100% credit toward SOC 2 / CGMP implementation.
3. **Marketplace Upside:** Native B2B vendor portals that turn your ERP from a cost-center into a revenue-generator.

Do you have 10 minutes next Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss the capital efficiency of the **2026 Strategic Reserve**?

Best,
[His Name]
Mimir Labs"
