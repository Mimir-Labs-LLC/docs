# SPEAKER PROPOSAL: CENTRALPA INNOVATE! 2026

**PROPOSED TITLE:** 
The End of the ERP "Software Tax": Resolving Technical Debt for the 2026 B2B Marketplace

**PRESENTER:** 
[Your Name], Founder, Mimir Labs

**SESSION TYPE:** 
Innovation Spotlight / Lightning Talk

**SESSION DESCRIPTION:**
Mid-market B2B firms in Central PA are currently facing a silent crisis: "The Legacy ERP Tax." As organizations attempt to scale into modern marketplaces, they are being held hostage by rigid, "closed-box" systems that demand 20% annual maintenance hikes while blocking innovation.

This session explores how Mimir Labs is utilizing its Yggdrasil ERP engine to resolve years of accumulated technical debt. We will discuss the shift toward marketplace-native infrastructure and why audit-ready, SOC 2-compliant systems are no longer optional for firms planning their 2026 roadmap. Attendees will walk away with a practical framework for identifying "Tech Debt" triggers and a strategy for achieving long-term cost certainty in their software stack.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS:**
1. Identifying the 3 "Silent Killers" of legacy ERP infrastructure.
2. The 2026 Compliance Wall: Why SOC 2 and CGMP are the new table stakes for scaling.
3. Architecture for Growth: How marketplace-native ERPs turn cost centers into revenue generators.

**WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CENTRAL PA:**
Central Pennsylvania is a powerhouse for manufacturing and logistics. By providing these firms with a modern, audit-ready alternative to predatory legacy pricing, we are strengthening the regional economy and ensuring our local trailblazers are ready for the global 2026 marketplace.
