# FULL PLATFORM DEMO: YGGDRASIL DETERMINISTIC ERP
## Objective: A Comprehensive Walkthrough of the Unified Operations Engine

### 1. THE UNIFIED CORE (DASHBOARD & CRM)
**Action:** Start on the Dashboard, then click CRM > Accounts.
- **Narrative:** "We begin at the Dashboard, the nerve center for Universal Business Intelligence. Navigating to CRM, we see our single source of truth for all B2B nodes. Whether a 'Customer' or 'Supplier,' every entity is an articulated part of the same deterministic framework."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Dashboard] -> Click [CRM] -> Click [Accounts].

### 2. THE REVENUE ENGINE (SALES & QUOTES)
**Action:** Click Sales > Quotes.
- **Narrative:** "The Sales module drives the 'Revenue' half of the equation. Here, Quotes aren't just documents; they are deterministic triggers that, once approved, automatically provision requirements across the entire supply chain."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Sales] -> Click [Quotes].

### 3. THE SUPPLY CHAIN (PURCHASING & LOGISTICS)
**Action:** Click Purchasing > Orders, then Logistics.
- **Narrative:** "Purchasing manages our 'Procurement' node. By linking orders directly to real-time inventory needs, we eliminate the 'Integration Tax.' Moving to Logistics, we see how the deterministic core orchestrates movement and fulfillment across the marketplace."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Purchasing] -> Click [Orders] -> Click [Logistics].

### 4. THE SHOP FLOOR (MANUFACTURING & PLM)
**Action:** Click Manufacturing, then PLM.
- **Narrative:** "Manufacturing is where we solve the 'Implementation Paradox.' Our articulated framework allows shop floor processes to flow through the system without 'bastardization.' PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) ensures every technical revision is tracked with total integrity."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Manufacturing] -> Click [PLM].

### 5. FINANCIAL INTEGRITY (FINANCE & PROJECTS)
**Action:** Click Finance, then Projects.
- **Narrative:** "The Finance module provides an immutable audit trail, hardened for SOC 2 and CGMP. This data feeds into Projects, allowing us to track real-time landed margins and project-based LTV without manual reconciliation."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Finance] -> Click [Projects].

### 6. QUALITY & SERVICE ORCHESTRATION
**Action:** Click Quality, then Service.
- **Narrative:** "Quality Management integrates 'Audit-Ready' testing directly into the production workflow. This feeds the Service module, which handles customer success and feedback loops to strengthen our Evangelizer network."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Quality] -> Click [Service].

### 7. HUMAN CAPITAL & INSIGHTS (HR & REPORTS)
**Action:** Click HR, then Reports.
- **Narrative:** "The HR module manages our most valuable nodes—the people. Finally, the Reports module delivers Universal BI, turning raw operational data into actionable intelligence across every department."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [HR] -> Click [Reports].

### 8. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (SETTINGS)
**Action:** Click Settings.
- **Narrative:** "Under Settings, we configure our deterministic logic gates. This is where we ensure the system fits the business process—protecting the structural integrity of your unique operations."
- **Scribe Step:** Click [Settings].

### **PRO-TIP FOR SCRIBE CAPTURE:**
- **Navigation Speed:** Give Scribe exactly 1 second between clicks to ensure the sidebar module changes are captured clearly.
- **Clean Data:** Ensure the 'LTV' and 'Status' columns are populated in a few rows to show the "Universal BI" in action during the scroll.
