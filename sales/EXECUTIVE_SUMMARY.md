# Mimir Labs — Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

The $10B+ global manufacturing ERP market is growing at 8-10% CAGR, yet mid-market manufacturers (10-500 employees) remain chronically underserved. Enterprise solutions are prohibitively expensive ($250K+ implementations). Lightweight tools lack depth. And the aging mid-market incumbents — Epicor, Sage, Infor — extract a punishing "Software Tax" through annual maintenance hikes, six-figure customizations, and upgrade paths that break workflows.

**80% of mid-market manufacturers are running on some combination of an outdated ERP, spreadsheets, and manual processes.**

## The Solution

**Yggdrasil** is the first Deterministic B2B Marketplace & Operations Engine — a modern, multi-tenant ERP platform that delivers enterprise-grade manufacturing capabilities at 10-50% of incumbent TCO.

**14 integrated modules** cover the complete operational lifecycle: CRM, Sales, Purchasing, Manufacturing, Warehouse, Logistics, Finance, PLM, Quality, Service, HR, Projects, Workflows, and Admin — with 150+ API endpoints, a native desktop client, and a web application.

**Two architectural innovations define the moat:**

1. **Deterministic Core** — Zero-bastardization migrations that eliminate technical debt instead of creating it. Universal Business Intelligence as a native feature.

2. **B2B Event Mesh** — Real-time supply chain orchestration via Redpanda/Kafka. A purchase order in one tenant becomes a sales order in the supplier's tenant instantly. No EDI. No re-keying. Each customer becomes an Evangelizer who pulls their trading partners onto the platform.

## Traction & Status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Product** | v0.4.4a alpha — 70+ features implemented, working desktop + web clients |

## Business Model

| Tier | Annual | Implementation | Year 1 Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter (3 modules) | $9,600 | $6,000 | $15,600 |

## The Ask

**$200,000** to harden the Deterministic Core (50%), finalize SOC 2/CGMP compliance (25%), fund White-Glove implementations for 5 Anchor partners (15%), and establish regional brand authority (10%).

## Team

**Christopher "Doc" Gaither** — Founder, CEO/COO. United States Marine, Mechanical Engineer, domain specialist in enterprise operations and deterministic systems architecture. Lean, engineering-first team augmented by AI-assisted development delivering 3x output per headcount.

## Why Now

The product is built. The market is ready. Every Anchor partner becomes an Evangelizer. Early capital seeds a network-effect flywheel that compounds non-linearly.
