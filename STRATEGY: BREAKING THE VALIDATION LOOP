# SCRIPT: THE 30-SECOND EXPO PITCH

**THE HOOK (0-10s):**
"Hi, I’m Doc Gaither, CEO of Mimir Labs. We’re here because we’ve found that mid-market 
manufacturers in PA are paying a $150,000 'Customization Tax' just to make their 
ERP software fit their actual business logic."

**THE VALUE (10-20s):**
"We’ve built Yggdrasil—it’s a deterministic operations engine. Instead of 
'bastardizing' code to fit a box, we use an articulated framework that allows your 
process to flow *through* the system. It’s zero-install, SOC 2 hardened, and it 
never breaks during an update."

**THE ASK (20-30s):**
"We’re currently onboarding 5 'Marketplace Anchors' for our 2026 Validation Cohort 
here in Harrisburg. If you’re tired of managing your margins in Excel, I’d love 
to show you how the deterministic core works."



1. Professional Roles (The Stakeholders)
The Operations Leader (COO / VP of Ops): Their primary pain is bottlenecks. They want a system that handles B2B marketplace logic natively so they can scale without manual workarounds.
The Financial Guardian (CFO / Finance Director): Their primary pain is cost uncertainty. They are tired of the "Software Tax" (15–20% annual maintenance hikes) and want a fixed, predictable SaaS rate like your $4,800/mo offer.
The Technical Architect (CTO / IT Director): Their primary pain is security & compliance. They are the ones who stay up at night worrying about the "2026 Compliance Wall" and SOC 2 / CGMP requirements.

2. Firmographics (The Ideal Company Profile)
Industry: Mid-market B2B Manufacturing, Wholesale Distribution, and Logistics.
Company Size: 50–250 employees. These firms are large enough to have complex ERP needs but small enough to still be agile.
Technographic Profile: Companies currently "locked-in" to legacy ERPs (e.g., NetSuite, Sage, or older Dynamics versions) that were not built for modern, API-first marketplace commerce.

3. Psychographics (The "Aha!" Motivations)
Anti-Legacy Sentiment: They value sovereignty over their data and are frustrated by the "closed-box" nature of traditional enterprise software.
Forward-Thinking Strategy: They are "Strategic Planners" looking 18–24 months ahead to the 2026 marketplace environment rather than just reacting to today’s fires.
Risk-Averse but Innovation-Hungry: They want a "no-chaos" migration path (like your Strategic Reserve) that minimizes operational risk while providing a massive leap in technical capability.
