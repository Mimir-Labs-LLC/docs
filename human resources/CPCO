# Job Description: Chief Product Compliance Officer (CPCO)

## **Role Overview**
The **CPCO** at Mimir Labs is the executive architect of **Ecosystem Integrity**. You are responsible for the high-level strategic planning and field-level execution of our **Quality Engineering (QE) Suite**. Your mission is to ensure that the Yggdrasil ERP acts as a "Bonded Conduit" for sanitized, high-trust data across the supply chain.

This is a leadership role defined by **Architecture and Education**: you design the compliance blueprints for the ecosystem and then lead the "boots-on-the-ground" training to ensure those blueprints are operationalized both internally and at our customers' sites.

## **The Dual Strategic Mandates**

### **1. The Customer’s Quality & Compliance Architecture (External)**
*   **High-Level QE Strategy:** Architect the strategic roadmap for the Yggdrasil QE Suite. You define how global regulations (FDA, ISO, GxP) are modeled as automated business logic so that compliance becomes an effortless byproduct of the supply chain.
*   **Ecosystem Sanitization Planning:** Design the high-level "Data Handshake" protocols. You define the standards for how raw data from external suppliers is sanitized and validated before it is permitted to enter a customer’s "World Tree."
*   **Boots-on-the-Ground Training:** Lead the deployment of the QE Suite at Tier-1 customer sites. You are responsible for training their Quality Directors and C-Suite to move from "manual paperwork" to "executive custody" of automated quality systems.
*   **Bonded Partner Onboarding:** Develop the strategic criteria for "Bonded Suppliers." You oversee the high-level audit and training of supplier teams to ensure they can meet the data-integrity standards required to join the Yggdrasil network.

### **2. The Internal Fortress & Cultural Integrity (Internal)**
*   **Internal Governance Planning:** Architect the high-level compliance posture for Mimir Labs (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA). You set the policy, while the engineering teams execute the technical gates.
*   **Staff Readiness & Education:** Conduct "boots-on-the-ground" training for our internal Product and Sales teams. You ensure every employee understands the "Rules of the Tree" and the gravity of the data integrity we promise our partners.
*   **Internal Quality Auditing:** Lead high-level internal reviews of our development and operational lifecycles to ensure they meet the same **ALCOA+** standards we demand of our ecosystem participants.
*   **Strategic Risk Mitigation:** Identify systemic regulatory risks to Mimir Labs and plan the "circuit-breaker" protocols needed to protect the company and its customers from external compliance shocks.

## **Key Responsibilities & Field Tasks**
*   **Taxonomy Workshops:** Lead "Blank Sheet" sessions with customer stakeholders to distill complex regulatory burdens into streamlined, strategic QE models.
*   **Ecosystem Readiness Assessments:** Conduct high-level site visits and assessments of prospective bonded partners to evaluate their operational fit for the network.
*   **Regulatory Diplomacy:** Serve as the technical authority in high-stakes discussions with regulatory bodies, representing both Mimir Labs and the collective integrity of the Yggdrasil ecosystem.

---

## **Key Competencies**
*   **Strategic Visionary:** Ability to plan multi-year, multi-organizational quality roadmaps that span global supply chains.
*   **Master Educator:** Exceptional at translating dense regulatory statutes into actionable, high-level strategy for non-technical executives.
*   **Operational Authority:** The presence and domain expertise to lead a room of veteran auditors or supply chain heads through a transformation.

---

## **Qualifications**
*   **Background:** 15+ years in **Quality Management Systems (QMS), Regulatory Affairs, or Global Supply Chain Strategy.**
*   **Expertise:** Extensive "boots-on-the-ground" experience in highly regulated sectors (e.g., MedTech, Aerospace, or Energy).
*   **Leadership:** Proven track record of leading large-scale organizational changes or multi-site quality system deployments.
