1. Multi-Tenant Infrastructure and Isolation
Yggdrasil Cloud is a shared multi-tenant environment. While customers share a common infrastructure to lower costs, Mimir Labs implements logical data level isolation. Each tenant’s data is isolated and invisible to other tenants via unique Tenant IDs and row-level security.
2. Federated B2B Event Broker
By opting into B2B interactions, you authorize the cross-tenant transmission of specific transaction data (e.g., PO/SO status). You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of data sent to partners and for maintaining your own internal compliance regarding these third-party relationships.
3. "Noisy Neighbor" and Performance Management
Mimir Labs monitors aggregate resource consumption to maintain a 20% performance buffer for all tenants. We reserve the right to suspend or migrate tenants consuming a disproportionate share of shared resources (e.g., >30% of total instance load) to a dedicated Silo environment to protect system integrity.
4. Data Ownership and Security
You retain ownership of all data inputted into the system ("Customer Data"). Mimir Labs maintains rigorous security measures, including AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit. Mimir Labs is not responsible for data loss resulting from unauthorized access achieved through compromised user credentials.
