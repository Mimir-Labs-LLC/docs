### 1. MISSION OBJECTIVE
The **2026 Validation Cohort** is an elite group of South Central PA manufacturers and distributors partnered with **Mimir Labs**. Our goal is to finalize the **Deterministic Core** of the Yggdrasil operations engine. This partnership is designed to eliminate the "ERP Customization Tax" and provide a "Clean Migration" path away from fragmented spreadsheet stacks and legacy technical debt.

### 2. PARTNER BENEFITS (The Founder Advantage)
- **LIFETIME FOUNDER RATES:** Access to the Enterprise Tier at a fixed rate of **$4,800/mo**, legally protected from the annual 15–20% maintenance hikes typical of legacy incumbents.
- **DIRECT ROADMAP INFLUENCE:** Priority access to the dev team to map "last-mile" workflows specific to your industry vertical.
- **IMPLEMENTATION CREDITS:** 100% of pre-order deposits credited toward "White-Glove" migration services.
- **AUDIT-READY INFRASTRUCTURE:** Early access to **SOC 2 Type II** and **CGMP** hardening protocols, ensuring your operations meet global compliance standards.

### 3. PARTNER COMMITMENTS (The R&D Contribution)
- **DATA TRANSPARENCY:** Providing anonymized "messy" data (logs, spreadsheets, and manual entry records) to stress-test the deterministic mapping layer.
- **LOGIC VALIDATION:** Participation in bi-weekly 30-minute sessions to verify that **Universal BI** outputs match real-world operational reality.
- **CASE STUDY RIGHTS:** Permission to publish anonymized ROI data to validate the Yggdrasil model for regional entities like [MANTEC](https://mantec.org).
