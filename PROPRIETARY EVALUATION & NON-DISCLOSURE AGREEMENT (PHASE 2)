- **TRADE SECRET SURVIVAL:** Notwithstanding the above, all obligations regarding **Trade Secrets** (as defined by the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act) shall survive indefinitely for as long as the information remains a trade secret.

### 3. RESTRICTIVE USE & NON-COMPETE
The Receiving Party agrees that Confidential Information is provided **solely** for technical vetting.
