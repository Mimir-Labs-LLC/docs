# BFTP VENTURE APPLICATION: FULL STRATEGIC PLAN (INTEGRATED)
## Mimir Labs LLC | Project Yggdrasil
**DATE:** February 2026  
**LOCATION:** Harrisburg, PA  
**PRINCIPAL:** Christopher "Doc" Gaither, CEO/COO

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mimir Labs is a Harrisburg-based firm disrupting the $50B ERP market with **Yggdrasil**, the first **Deterministic B2B Marketplace & Operations Engine**. We solve the "Implementation Paradox" by replacing $150k custom subsidies with a **Deterministic Core**, while simultaneously building a **Live B2B Ecosystem**. By allowing regional manufacturers and distributors to trade on a single, immutable "Source of Truth," we transform our initial customers into **Evangelizers** who pull their entire supply chains into the Yggdrasil ecosystem to eliminate "Integration Taxes."

### 2. THE DUAL-VALUE ARCHITECTURE: HOOK & MOAT
- **THE DETERMINISTIC CORE (The Hook):** A modular, articulated framework that ensures "Zero-Bastardization" migrations. This stops the "Technical Debt" cycle and provide **Universal Business Intelligence (UBI)** as a native architectural feature.
- **THE B2B MARKETPLACE (The Moat):** Yggdrasil is a "Networked ERP." Once an Anchor Partner is onboarded, they become an **Evangelizer** for the platform, incentivizing their upstream suppliers and downstream distributors to join to benefit from real-time procurement and zero-latency data reconciliation.

### 3. 3-YEAR FINANCIAL & NETWORK GROWTH MODEL


| Year | Phase | Active Nodes | Scaling Factor | Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Validation | 5 "Anchors" | 1.0x (Direct Sales) | **$288,000** |
| **2** | Launch | 35 Nodes | 2.5x (**Evangelizer** Pull) | **$2,016,000** |
| **3** | Growth | 150 Nodes | 4.5x (Marketplace Viral) | **$8,640,000** |

**Note on Scaling:** Growth in Year 2 and 3 is non-linear. By converting early adopters into **Evangelizers**, we drastically reduce our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) while increasing Lifetime Value (LTV) through supply chain lock-in.

### 4. MANAGEMENT TEAM & STRATEGIC ADVISORY
- **Lead:** Christopher "Doc" Gaither, CEO/COO. Domain specialist in enterprise operations and deterministic systems architecture.
- **Talent Strategy:** Post-funding recruitment of Senior Systems Engineering and B2B Security specialists to harden the transaction layer.
- **Regional Support:** Active collaboration with [Harrisburg LaunchBox](https://harrisburg.launchbox.psu.edu) and [MANTEC](https://mantec.org) for cohort validation and "Anchor" partner identification.

---

### 5. USE OF FUNDS ($200,000 STRATEGIC ALLOCATION)
- **Technical R&D (50%):** Hardening the Deterministic Core and B2B Marketplace connectivity for PA-specific manufacturing workflows.
- **Compliance & Security (25%):** Finalizing **SOC 2 Type II and CGMP** protocols for secure B2B data orchestration.
- **Sales Engineering (15%):** Supporting "White-Glove" implementations for the first 5 "Marketplace Anchors."
- **Operations (10%):** Regional brand authority and "De-Exceling" thought leadership campaigns.

---

### 6. REGIONAL ECONOMIC IMPACT & EXIT STRATEGY
**The Harrisburg Hub:** By establishing a high-density B2B marketplace in South Central PA, Mimir Labs prevents "Capital Flight" to out-of-state legacy vendors and anchors high-wage tech roles locally.
- **Exit Path A:** Strategic acquisition by a global Logistics or ERP firm seeking a proprietary, deterministic B2B marketplace.
- **Exit Path B:** Independent scale to a Mid-Atlantic "Category King" in Connected ERP through Series A/B funding.
