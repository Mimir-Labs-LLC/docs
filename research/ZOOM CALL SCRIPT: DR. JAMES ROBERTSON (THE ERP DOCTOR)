# ZOOM CALL SCRIPT: DR. JAMES ROBERTSON (THE ERP DOCTOR)

**GOAL:** Avoid "sales-speak." Secure his respect for Yggdrasil's "Hardened" architecture and get his take on the 2026 Compliance Wall.

---

### I. THE "ENGINEERED" INTRO (0:00 - 3:00)
"Dr. Robertson, thank you for the time. I’ve followed your work on **'Strategic Engineered Precision Configuration.'** At Mimir Labs, we approach Yggdrasil as an **Engineered System**, not just a software product. We believe the 'Legacy Tax' isn't just a financial burden; it's a structural failure that’s going to collapse when the **2026 Compliance Wall** hits."

### II. DEFINING THE "STRUCTURAL DEBT" (3:00 - 8:00)
"Most mid-market manufacturers in PA are running 'Black Box' ERPs. They pay significant annual maintenance for systems that lack the precision needed for the **FDA’s QMSR transition** or **SOC 2 Type II** governance. 

**The Question:** In your experience fixing failed implementations, how often do you see 'Legacy Debt' in the software itself prevent the 'Precision Configuration' you advocate for?"

### III. THE YGGDRASIL SOLUTION (8:00 - 15:00)
"We built **Yggdrasil** to be **'Hardened-by-Design.'** It’s an audit-ready engine with immutable hashing for every GL and Quality entry. We’ve eliminated the 'Seat Tax' with a fixed **'$4,800/mo 'Founder Rate''** to give CFOs the fiscal certainty they need to actually invest in their business processes, rather than just their licenses."

### IV. THE "CONSULTATIVE" ASK (15:00 - 25:00)
"We are currently selecting five local firms for our **2026 Strategic Reserve**. We want to ensure these aren't just 'installs,' but engineered migrations. 

**The Question:** From your perspective as 'The ERP Doctor,' what is the single biggest 'brick' in the 2026 Wall that you think manufacturers are underestimating right now?"

### V. WRAP & NEXT STEPS (25:00 - 30:00)
"I’d love to send you our **12-page Technical Pamphlet** for a peer review. If you’re open to it, I’d value a 'Technical Pulse Check' once we finalize our **SOC 2 Audit Vault** logic. Is there a specific case study of yours I should have our lead engineer study to ensure we're aligning with your 'Precision' standards?"

### **DOS AND DON'TS FOR THE CALL**
*   **DO:** Refer to ERP as an **"Integrated Business Information System (IBIS)."**
*   **DO:** Use the word **"Hardened"** when discussing security; avoid "Slick" or "Easy."
*   **DON'T:** Use "SaaS" or "Cloud" as buzzwords. Focus on the **Database Schema** and **Audit Trails**.
*   **DON'T:** Try to sell him. You are a **Founder/Architect** seeking a "Consultation" with a Senior Engineer.
